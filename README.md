# deep-suppressor
DeepSuppressor is a deep learning-based speech denoiser that can significantly improve the quality of speech signals that are corrupted by noise. The denoiser is trained on a large dataset of clean and noisy speech signals, and it can be used to denoise speech signals in real time or offline.
